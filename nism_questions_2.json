For a put option which is In-the-money, the intrinsic value is the excess of Strike price (X) over the spot price (S). Thus, the intrinsic value of put option can be calculated as X-S, with a minimum value possible as zero. For eg — If strike price is 100 and spot price is 90, the intrinsic value is 10.
