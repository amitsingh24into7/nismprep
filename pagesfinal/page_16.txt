loss (-) ?

+ 20,000

- 20,000

+ 10,000

- 10,000

X WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

~ 10,000

Explanation:
When one sells a put option, the view is bullish ie. price will rise. Here the price has fallen by Rs 60 (500-440). So there is a loss of Rs 60.
When one sells an option, premium is received. Premium received is Rs 50.

Therefore Net loss = 60 - 50 = 10 x lot sixe of 1000 = 10000 loss.

Calculation of volatility is not a secret. There are many formulas available. For example, many option traders calculate this expected volatility by running the Black-Scholes model in the reverse order.
