% WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

This straddle has two break-even points

Explanation:

A straddle has two break-even points because the trader profits when the stock moves significantly in either direction.
Break-even Calculation:

1. Break-even for Call Option (Upper Break-even Point):

Strike Price + Total Premium = 100 + 15= 115

2. Break-even for Put Option (Lower Break-even Point):

‘Strike Price - Total Premium = 100 - 15 = 85

Therefore, only option - 'This straddle has two break-even points’ is correct.
