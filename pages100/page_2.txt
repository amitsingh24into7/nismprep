Buying 1 Sept ABC futures contract at 1700

Selling 1 Sept ABC futures contract at 1900

To make a profit of Rs 5000, he has to earn Rs 100 per share ( 5000 / 50 (lot size) = 100 )
Since he has gone short, he will make a profit when the price falls and he buys at the reduced price.
He has sold at Rs 1800, so when he buys back at Rs 1700 he make Rs 100 profit per share.

Rs 100 X 50 ( Lot size ) = Rs 5000 profit.
