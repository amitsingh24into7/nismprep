For which type of options is it profitable to exercise the options ?
At the Money
Out of the Money
In the Money
None of the above

% WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

In the Money
Explanation: 4

IN THE MONEY - A call option with a strike price that is lower than the market price of the underlying asset, or a put option with a strike price that is higher than the market price of the underlying asset. In the
money means that your stock option is worth money and you can turn around and sell or exercise it.

For example, consider a stock that is trading at Rs 100. For such a stock, call options with strike prices below Rs 100 would be In the money calls ( ie Rs 80, Rs 90 calls) while put options with strike prices above
Rs 100 (Rs 110 , Rs 120 calls etc.) would be In the money puts.

For easy understanding, those calls or puts which are profitable are In the Money.

In contrast, the buyer of a call option has limited risk, restricted to the premium paid for the option.
