- Possibility of price movement: Since the underlying asset could change in price before expiry, the option retains extra value beyond its intrinsic value due to this uncertainty.

limits on day one. Based on this, which of the following statements is true ?

The minimum exposure possible for the two brokers may change from time to time based on the changes in those asset valuations, even if they do not withdraw the assets deposited

The minimum exposure possible for the two brokers will remain same for ever, even if they withdraw the asset deposited subsequently

None of the above

%X WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

The minimum exposure possible for the two brokers may change from time to time based on the changes in those asset valuations, even if they do not withdraw the assets deposited

Identify the True formula for Cost of Carry model.
Price of Futures = Cost of carry
Price of Futures = Spot price
Price of Futures = Spot + Cost of carry
Price of Futures = Spot - Cost of carry

vCORRECT ANSWER
Explanation:

Cost of Carry is the relationship between futures prices and spot prices. For stock derivatives, carrying cost Is the interest paid to finance the purchase.

For example, assume the share of XYZ Ltd is trading at Rs. 500 in the cash market. A person wishes to buy the share, but does not have money. In that case he would have to borrow Rs. 500 at the rate of, say,
12% per annum, So 1% ie. Rs 5 ( 1% of Rs 500) is the per month interest cost. and this Rs 5 is the cost of carry.

‘The future price (ideally) at the beginning of month will be Spot Price + Cost of Carry ie. Rs 500 + Rs 5=Rs 505.

Identify the FALSE statement.
For Call Options : With decrease in strike price, the premium on call increases
For Call Options : With increase in strike price, the premium on call increases
For Put Options : With increase in strike price, the premium on put increases
For Put Options : With decrease in strike price, the premium on put decreases

X WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

For Call Options : With increase in strike price, the premium on call increases

Explanation:
Call Option Premium Behavior:

ACall Option gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to buy an asset at a specified strike price before expiration.

© If the strike price decreases, the option becomes more attractive because the buyer can purchase the asset at a cheaper price. This increases the premium. (Statement 4 is TRUE)
* Conversely, if the strike price increases, the call option becomes less attractive, reducing the premium. (Statement 2 is FALSE)

Put Option Premium Behavior:
A Put Option gives the buyer the right to sell an asset at a specified strike price before expiration.

© If the strike price increases, the put option becomes more valuable since the asset can be sold at a higher price, leading to a higher premium. (Statement 3 is TRUE)
© If the strike price decreases, the put option becomes less attractive, leading to a lower premium. (Statement 4is TRUE)

Conclusion: Since statement 2 contradicts the basic principle of call options, it is the false statement.

If there is no cross margining between cash and derivative segments of an exchange, this will
Promotes economic inefficiency
Increase the cost of trading
Reduces the volumes for given level of risk capital in the economy
All of the above

X WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

All of the above
Explanation: 4
If cross margining is not allowed between the cash and derivative segments, it leads to the following:

Promotes economic inefficiency -Without cross margining, traders must maintain separate margins for positions that may offset each other (e.g., long in cash and short in futures), which is inefficient from a
capital utilization perspective.

Increases the cost of trading - More margin requirements mean higher capital tied up, increasing the opportunity cost and overall trading cost.

Reduces the volumes for a given level of risk capital in the economy - Since capital is not optimally used, the same amount of risk capital supports fewer trades, reducing trading volumes.

Mr X sells one ABC stock futures contract at Rs. 745. What is his profit (+) or loss (-), if he purchases the contract back at Rs. 754 ? Lot size is 1500
+13500
-13500

Ashort position in a put option can be closed out by taking a long position in a put option of any exercise price and exercise date
Ashort position in a put option can be closed out by taking a long position in a call option with the same exercise price and exercise date
A short position in a put option can be closed out by taking a long position in a put option with the same exercise price and exercise date
Ashort position in a put option can be closed out by taking a short position in a call option with the same exercise price and exercise date

CORRECT ANSWER

Explanation:

Aclosing transaction for an option involves the sale or purchase of an option contract with the same terms (contract specifications), i.e., an option with the same strike price and same expiry date.
Ashort position in a put option means the trader has sold a put option and is obligated to buy the underlying asset if exercised.

To close out this position, the trader must take an opposite position, which is buying (going long) the same put option with the same strike price and expiration date.

This ensures that any potential losses or obligations from the short put are neutralized by the long put.

No, its not true for all options
Yes, its true but only for Call options
Yes, its true but only for Put options

Delta refers to the Rate of change in the
Option premium per day
Option premium for a unit change in spot price of the underlying
Option premium for a unit change in interest rate
Option premium for a unit change in volatility of the underlying

CORRECT ANSWER A
Explanation:

Option premiums change with changes in the factors that determine option pricing i.e., factors such as strike price, volatility, term to maturity, etc. The sensitivities most commonly tracked in the market are
known collectively as “Greeks” represented by Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho

The most important of the ‘Greeks’ is the option’s “Delta”. This measures the sensitivity of the option value to a given small change in the price of the underlying asset. It may also be seen as the speed with
which an option moves with respect to price of the underlying asset.

Delta = Change in option premium/ Unit change in price of the underlying asset
