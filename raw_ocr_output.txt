True
False

¥ CORRECT ANSWER A
Explanation:

The option premium consists of two components - intrinsic value and time value.

The intrinsic value of an option refers to the amount by which the option is in-the-money i.e., the amount an option buyer will realize, before adjusting for premium paid, if he exercises the option instantly.

Going short on the stock futures contract while simultaneously buying the stock

XX WRONG ANSWER

that one must buy the underpriced contract and sell the overpriced one.

Hence, the arbitrageur needs to compute the fair price of both futures contracts and compare these with the traded prices, to decide which contract is overpriced and which one is underpriced.

Identify the FALSE statement with respect to Options.
Option contracts are NOT symmetrical regarding the rights and obligations of the parties involved
Buyer of an option gets the right while seller of an option bears the obligation
Options contracts have non-linear payoffs
Options contracts have linear payoffs

> WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

Options contracts have linear payoffs
Explanation: A
Options have non-linear payoffs: The profit/loss profile of options Is not a straight line; it depends on factors like strike price, premium, volatility, and time decay.

In case of futures contracts, long as well as short position has unlimited profit or loss potential. This results into linear payoffs for futures contracts. However, option contracts do not have linear payoffs as the
buyers and sellers have different obligations and risk factors.

The buyer of an option has limited risk (premium which he pays) but can earn unlimited profits whereas the seller of the option has unlimited risk but can earn only limited profits (premium which he receives).
Option contracts are not symmetrical as the buyers and sellers have different obligations and risk factors. The buyer has limited risk where as seller of an option has unlimited risk.

A trading member reaches his prescribed position limits, therefore he will
be allowed to take only 5% additional exposure
not be able to reverse his position
be able to take fresh new positions for his clients but not in his proprietary account
not be able to open new positions

v CORRECT ANSWER 4a
Explanation:

contracts that a trading member or client, acting individually or together with others, can own.

When client-level position limits are exceeded, the clearing member/ trading member must ensure that the client does not take any fresh positions and the existing positions must be reduced within permissible
limits.
