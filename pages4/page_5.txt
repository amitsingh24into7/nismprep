If the interest rate increases, the premium on CALL option will also increase - State True or False ?
True
False

¥ CORRECTANSWER
Explanation:

Relationship between Interest Rates and Option Premiums:

- Interest rates affect the cost of carry. Higher interest rates increase the cost of holding the underlying asset.

- Conversely, for put options, higher interest rates tend to decrease the premium.

Therefore, an increase in interest rates generally leads to an increase in the premium of a call option.
