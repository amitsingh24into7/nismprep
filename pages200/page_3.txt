An Investor Mr Shah wants to buy 8 contracts of January series at Rs 740 and an investor Mr Patel wants to sell 5 contracts of February series at Rs 754. Initial Margin is fixed at 6%.
How much initial margin has to be collected from them ? Market lot is 250.

Rs 56,550

Rs 88,800

Rs 1,45,350

Rs 1,87,600

¥ CORRECT ANSWER A
Explanation:

Margin to be collected from Mr Shah : Rs 740 X 8 contracts X 250 (Market lot) at 6%
= Rs 1480000 x 6% = Rs 88,800
Margin to be collected from Mr Patel : Rs 754 X 5 contracts X 250 (Market lot) at 6%
= Rs 942500 x 6% = Rs 56,550

So the total margin : 88,800 + 56,550 = Rs 145350

In case of CALL OPTION, it gives the buyer the right to
buy the underlying at market price
buy the underlying at set price
sell the underlying at market price
sell the underlying at set price

> WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

buy the underlying at set price
Explanation:
Acall option is a financial instrument that gives the buyer the right, but not an obligation, to buy a set quantity of a security at a set strike price at some time on or before expiration.

In easy terms - what ever may be the market price, the buyer will get the security at the set price or strike price as he has paid a premium for it.

The spot price of LKK share is Rs 300, the put option of Strike Price Rs 280 is “
In the money
Out of the money
At the money
None of the above

¥ CORRECT ANSWER
Explanation:

A put option is "In the Money” if Strike Price > Spot Price (because the holder can sell at a higher price than the market).
A put option is “At the Money” if Strike Price = Spot Price.
A put option is "Out of the Money” if Strike Price < Spot Price (because selling at the strike price is less profitable than selling at the market price).

In the above example, since Rs. 280 (Strike Price) < Rs. 300 (Spot Price), the put option is not profitable and is considered Out of the Money (OTM).
