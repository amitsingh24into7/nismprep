% WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

Place a stop loss sell order at Rs 73.50

Explanation:

Mr. Prashant has bought one lot ie. 2000 shares and does not want to have a loss of more than Rs 3000. So 3000 / 2000 = Rs 1.50. So per share he should not lose more than Rs 1.50.
His buying price is Rs 75. So 75 - 1.50 = 73.50 will be his stop loss price price.

When the share falls to Rs 73.50 , he will stand to lose Rs 3000.

You have a short position in LPQ Stock futures at Rs 350 (one lot size is 500 shares) and you have made a profit of Rs 28000. To do this you will have to :
Sell one lot ar Rs 406
Sell one lot at Rs 294
Buy one lot at 406
Buy one lot at Rs 294

XX WRONG ANSWER
CORRECT ANSWER:

Buy one lot at Rs 294

Explanation:

Profit = Rs 28000 , Lot size = 500 , So per share profit = 28000/500 = Rs 56

Since he has a short position, he will be in a profit if the share falls and he buys at a lower price.

So the price has to fall by Rs 56 from Rs 350 = Rs 294
